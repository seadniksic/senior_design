# Config
- Auto boots to normal mode so no config there needed.
- default mode after power on is CONFIGMODE
- modes
  - get all the outputs raw and unfused, use mode AMG
  - NDOF_FMC_OFF uses accel mag and gyro and then provides absolute orientation
    - so does NDOF mode but idk what the difference is.
    - NDOF uses more power. FMC = fast magnetometer calibration
  - operating mode set by writing to OPR_MODE reg, see table 3-5
  - TAKES 7ms to switch from configmode to any operation mode
  - vice verse, its 19ms
- fusion modes
  - absolute with respect to earth's magnetic field
  - calculates direction  of the north pole. 
  - In non-absolute or relative orientation modes, the heading of the sensor can vary depending on how the sensor is placed initially.
- can remap axes depending on mounting and can also remap the sign of the axis too. like switch the direction. 
- if running in fusion mode, NEED to go back to configuration mode to configure it. 
- you can select your units!!


- M4G to start. no magnetometer calibration is needed.
